The 'secondary' color serves as a background for content blocks or secondary UI areas, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons in these areas to maintain readability. The 'contentBlockBackground' custom color is ideal for subtle section backgrounds that need to stand out gently against the main background without overwhelming the design. Use 'buttonOutline' for secondary or outlined buttons to maintain brand consistency. The 'iconColor' is suited for icons and minor graphic elements, providing a muted contrast that complements the overall palette. This palette ensures accessibility and visual hierarchy while maintaining a modern, tech-savvy aesthetic.",

The 'contentBlockBackground' against 'background' offers a gentle contrast suitable for non-textual UI elements and backgrounds.

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color predominantly for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and interactive elements to draw user attention effectively. The 'primaryForeground' color should be used for text and icons placed on 'primary' backgrounds to ensure readability. The 'secondary' color serves as the main color for large background areas and text in dark mode or high-contrast sections, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons on these dark backgrounds. The 'background' color is the base for most page backgrounds, providing a clean and neutral canvas. The 'backgroundDark' custom color is reserved for dark-themed sections or overlays, maintaining contrast with 'secondaryForeground'. The 'accentBlueLight' can be used sparingly for subtle highlights or hover states to complement the 'primary' color. All colors should be combined to maintain strong contrast ratios, ensuring accessibility and visual clarity across the site.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The combination of 'primary' (#5C5CF6) with 'primaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) meets WCAG AA standards for text and UI elements, providing sufficient contrast. The 'secondary' (#000000) and 'secondaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) pairing offers excellent contrast, suitable for all text sizes and UI components. The 'background' (#FFFFFF) with 'secondary' (#000000) text also meets WCAG AAA standards for body text. The 'backgroundDark' (#121212) with 'secondaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) ensures high contrast for dark mode or dark sections. Overall, the palette supports accessible design with clear visual hierarchy and legibility."
